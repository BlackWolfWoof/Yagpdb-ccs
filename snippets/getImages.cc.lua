Note: Scrapes all images from attachments and links, and adds it to a given embed with it's own field if there is more then one image.
      -They are linked and are displayed by the file name and the file type `FileName.Type` ex: example.png, this is linked to the image

Note: The emebed MUST have one field before it and the, you can try editing this in lines 29-35 (On Github)
      
Note: I'm not sure if this actually works, I did some editing so it'd work as a snippit, but I'm fairly sure it'll work
