# Starboard plugins
Starboard works fine without the plugins, there's GitHub, Twitter, and YouTube.

_but it's so much better_

Please know, that these plugins only work with my starboard system.

## GitHub
There is a few different versions of it, I suggest trying it for yourself, it doesn't do much but it makes it look a lot nicer, I suggest adding it.
It supports, profiles, webhook posts, files, as long as it is done via link.

## Twitter
