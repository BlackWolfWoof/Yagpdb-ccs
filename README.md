ERMAGERD? I HAVE THREE STARS?!
paggy commands are in go, yaggy is lua, so you can see the percentage of yag vs pag!

## To Do
- [ ] Mod Creafter's CC command with more customizability (or just make my own)
- [ ] Finish starboard
- [ ] Finish poll re-make, more features (made base poll creation)
- [ ] Give tic-tac-toev2 customizable in discord, not CP
- [ ] a secret thing
- [ ] Fix maze command since the website is annoying (no fucking clue)

## Uhh Welcome?
So here you can find some custom commands to add to your guild/sever to do stuff.
some of my personal favorites is picture and maze, both are under fun.
