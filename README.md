# Yagpdb+Pagstdb-ccs
I have a star owo?
paggy commands are in go, yaggy is lua, so you can see the percentage of yag vs pag!

## To Do
- [ ] Mod Creafter's CC command with more customizability
- [ ] Finish starboard
- [ ] Finish poll re-make, more features
- [ ] Give tic-tac-toev2 customizable in discord, not CP
- [ ] a secret thing
- [ ] Fix maze command since the website is annoying
- [ ] add `se` and `ce` support to Tagv2 to make tagv3?

## Uhh Welcome?
So here you can find some custom commands to add to your guild/sever to do stuff.
some of my personal favorites is picture and maze, both are under fun.

I'm an admin on a few servers, but I mainly enjoy making servers and making tools to keep the community involved,
if you ever need help with making a server or want a decent custom command feel free to reach out.
Please nothing too complex, I'm no pro I'm intermediate.
