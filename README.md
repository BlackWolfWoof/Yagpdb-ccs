## Uhh Welcome?
So here you can find some custom commands to add to your guild/sever to do stuff.
some of my personal favorites is picture and maze, both are under fun.

I'm an admin on a few servers, but I mainly enjoy making servers and making tools to keep the community involved,
if you ever need help with making a server or want a decent custom command feel free to reach out.
Please nothing too complex, I'm no pro I'm intermediate.
